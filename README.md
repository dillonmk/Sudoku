# Sudoku
Sudoku board generator and eventually game

main.py will create a sudoku game (matrix of numbers) based on the difficulty given. 

The other file (game_play) is work in progress, and will probably not be completed for a while. 
The idea was to create a small windowed app using tkinter to take the game generated by main.py 
and put it in a GUI for playing the game.
